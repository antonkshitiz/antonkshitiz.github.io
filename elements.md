<p>Hi I'm Kshitiz Khandelwal, a third year undergraduate student from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I'm pursuing a dual degree major in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering and a micro-specialization in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Coming from a tech-school, to pursue my interest in using computational data analytics for solving quantitative finance and business problems, I’ve participated in multiple business competitions and have done internships in the field of credit score modelling and algorithmic trading.</p> 

<p>I started off my journey at IIT Kharagpur by exploring the fields of robotics and embedded systems by being a part of Technology Robotix Society and Kharagpur RoboSoccer Students' Group. In my second year of study, I pivoted completely to pursue the fields of Quantitative Finance and Business Strategy full-time. I was also a part of Business Club during my first year. I have a decent experience in the aforementioned fields through various courses, campus projects and internships. My superficial interest in finance, was sparked by  Adam McKay's movie, The Big Short which is based on the subprime mortgage financial crisis of 2007-08. I’m also an active contributor to IIT Kharagpur’s Finance Reading Group.</p>

<p>During my second year summers, I interned at a couple of great fintech startups. I was a part of the Data Science Team at FinBox, Gurgaon for over four months. My project was based on credit score modelling using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I also interned with the Growth Team of Mudrex, Bangalore which is a GUI based algorithmic trading platform. My project was based on developing technical analysis based trading strategies in the cryptocurrency markets for their clients. Both my internships gave me great exposure to the fields I was looking forward to pursuing in the long run. Currently, as the Head of a techno-management society, Technology Robotix Society, I’ve had the opportunity to be the Project Head and Organiser of IIT Kharagpur’s first Winter School for AI and Robotics wherein I volunteered to mentor over hundred AI enthusiasts in a fifteen-day long workshop on Machine Learning.</p>

<p>IIT Kharagpur has provided me with exposure to numerous different challenges that have helped me grow as an individual and a team player. I’ve been actively involved in various curricular and co-curricular activities. Through various business model and case study competitions, I’ve developed a structured problem solving and analytical thinking ability. I’ve had the privilege of working with a highly qualified gold-winning team in the 8th Inter IIT Tech Meet held at IIT Roorkee. We conceptualized and developed from scratch, our brainchild eSaathi - An Assistive UI Platform with an aim to unleash Bharat's true digital potential by providing assistive handholding for using mobile applications. Ever since then, we've collectively won more than 10 business competitions like the 3M-CII Young Innovator's Challenge Awards and the Empresario Social Business Model Competition.</p>

<p>I love to watch TV Shows and read non-fiction novels on Finance in my free time. My taste in shows and books is quite evident from the theme of this website and some other interesting things I've posted in the "Insights" section. My earphones are plugged into my ears 24x7 with mostly metal or pop playing in the background. I'm quite active on social media and my Instagram and Facebook walls are flooded with shit-posts and memes. One of my biggest aims in life is to get myself exposed to as many personal and professional experiences as possible. </p>
