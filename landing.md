					<h3>Modern Portfolio Theory for Cryptocurrency</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Just from checking out the digital asset prices on a cryptocurrency exchange, one can see that they are highly correlated with one another.  If Bitcoin is in the red for the day, nearly every cryptocurrency on the homepage will be in the red, if Bitcoin is in the green, – so would be the others. In particular, the Modern Portfolio Theory advocates diversification of securities and asset classes or the benefits of not putting all your eggs in one basket.</p>

					<h3>Bitcoin Derivatives</h3>
				</header>
				<p>A derivative is a financial contract between two or more parties based on the future price of an underlying asset. Financial derivatives are discussed a lot when it comes to the crypto industry, especially concerning futures contracts for Bitcoin or altcoins. High-profile American investor Warren Buffet once called derivatives “financial weapons of mass destruction” sharing a commonly held view that they were to blame for the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.</p>

					<h3>Investor Psychology and Trading Bias</h3>
				</header>
				<p>When computer science was introduced to automate decision making, many hoped computers would reduce prejudice and discrimination. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, as machines are made and trained by humans, and the data that those machines use, is input by humans. Hence it is empirical for programs or in our case talking about algorithmic trading to amplify biases and errors.</p>

					<h3>Backtest MasterClass</h3>
				</header>
				<p>If you knew your trading strategy would give correct signals only 50% of the time, would you commit your scarce savings to trade with it? Now, what if it worked 75% of the time? Would you still be hesitant? Backtesting gives you the confidence to know that your trading strategy will work. Backtesting is simply the intentional testing procedure to verify that your trading strategy works using historical (back) market data and market conditions.</p>

					<h3>Moving Average Convergence Divergence MasterClass</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock’s price. MACD helps investors understand whether the bullish or bearish movement in the price is strengthening or weakening.

					<h3>The Volatility Channels Trading Strategy</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Volatility Channels are a type of indicator that plot volatility-related lines above and below the market. These lines are variously known as channels, envelopes, or bands. They widen as volatility increases, and narrow as volatility decreases. We’ll be using a very effective method of detecting a change in the volatility of the market using the squeeze of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels.</p>

					<h3>The Double-Cross Trading Strategy</h3>

					<h3>The Multiple Time-Frames Trading Strategy</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile technical indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions in commodities, indices, cryptocurrencies, stocks and other tradable assets. Like any other oscillator, the CCI needs to be combined with an additional trading tool or with multiple time-frames to make a trading strategy.</p>
