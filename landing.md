					<h3>The Multiple Time-Frames Trading Strategy</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a versatile technical indicator that can be used to identify a new trend or warn of extreme conditions in commodities, indices, cryptocurrencies, stocks and other tradable assets. Like any other oscillator, the CCI needs to be combined with an additional trading tool or with multiple time-frames to make a trading strategy.</p>

				</header>

The RSI was created by Welles Wilder and many trading strategies have been designed around this indicator. The 20-SMA with RSI trading strategy in a trending market has the potential to add hundreds of pips to your count.</p>
