					<h3>The Directional Movement Trading System</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Detecting a strong directional move is the most important skill for all traders to have. Trend chasing is the most popular technical method of profitable trading.

					<h3>The Volatility Channels Trading Strategy</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Volatility Channels are a type of indicator that plot volatility-related lines above and below the market. These lines are variously known as channels, envelopes, or bands. They widen as volatility increases, and narrow as volatility decreases. Weâ€™ll be using a very effective method of detecting a change in the volatility of the market using the squeeze of Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels.</p>

The 20-SMA with RSI trading strategy in a trending market has the potential to add hundreds of pips to your count.</p>
