"Well, how big is the universe? Infinite. How do you know? I know because all the data indicate it. But it hasn't been proven yet? No. You haven't seen it. How do you know for sure? I don't, I just believe it. It's the same with love, I guess."
-Alicia Nash, A Beautiful Mind

"You know, they call us traders 'gamblers'. The world economy's just one big casino, fueled by a giant debt bubble and computer driven derivatives. And there's only one thing better than being a gambler at a Casino. That's being the House. There's a systemized machine out there sucking capital from localities and injecting it into global markets where it can be used to speculate and manipulate. And if something goes wrong, there are bailouts and bailins, federal aid and easing. Where the government doesn't hunt you down but instead gives you a nice soft net to land in. I want to become a Bank."
-Bobby Axelrod, Billions

"Likes are like sugar - a quick hit that goes straight to the brain and throws around a bunch of happy hormones. But you know that from Biology, serotonin and all that. Why do you think Mark Zuckerberg is so loaded? He sells absolutely tons of happy hormones to addicts, addicts like you!"
-Mo, How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast)

“Choose one thing and become a master of it. Choose a second thing and become a master of that. When you become a master of two worlds (say engineering and business), you can bring them together in a way that will a) introduce hot ideas to each other, so they can have idea sex and make idea babies that no one has seen before and b) create a competitive advantage because you can move between worlds, speak both languages, connect the tribes, mash the elements to spark fresh creative insight until you wake up with the epiphany that changes your life. When you work in a different context from the majority of people in your field, you can make distinct and unique connections. You can integrate and cross-pollinate different ideas. You can avoid dogmatic thinking and expectations. You can learn to integrate ideas from seemingly dissimilar fields."
-Justine Musk, Elon Musk's Ex-Spouse

"Why finance?
The stock market is a representation of the psychology of the entire world at any given moment. Data is an exact thumbprint of that moment. I get to know what the world is thinking and feeling and what it will do next."
-Quant Interviewee, Billions

"Adam Smith said the best result comes from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself. Incomplete. Incomplete, OK? Because the best result will come from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself and the group. Governing dynamics gentlemen, governing dynamics."
-John Nash, A Beautiful Mind

"French philosopher, mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal, argued a rational person should believe God exists because you have everything to gain if you're right, and nothing to lose if you're wrong."
-Sheldon Cooper, Young Sheldon

"A stock is like a living organism, a sparrow, say. And we are able to create a emergent-based abstraction of that sparrow which closely approximates the sparrow itself accounting for migration patterns wind, weather, and other variables. We can create a similar abstraction of a stock combining the information from the specific ETFs which represent its underlying dependencies. And if we apply this to the stock, we can predict its delta following the path of its abstracted self because nature follows abstraction."
-Taylor Mason, Billions

“Mortgage backed securities, subprime loans, tranches… Pretty confusing right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it’s supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or even better, for you to leave them the fuck alone.”
-Margot Robbie, The Big Short

“What do I do? System Architecture. Networking and Security. No one in this house can touch me on that. But does anyone appreciate that? While you were busy minoring in gender studies and singing acapella at Sarah Lawrence, I was getting root access to NSA servers. I was a click away from starting a second Iranian revolution. I prevent cross site scripting, I monitor for DDoS attacks, emergency database rollbacks, and faulty transaction handlings. The internet, heard of it? Transfers half a petabyte of data a minute, do you have any idea how that happens? All of those YouPorn ones and zeros streaming directly to your shitty little smart phone day after day. Every dipshit who shits his pants if he can’t get the new dubstep Skrillex remix in under 12 seconds. It’s not magic, it’s talent and sweat. People like me ensuring your packets get delivered unsniffed. So what do I do? I make sure that one bad config on one key component doesn’t bankrupt the entire fucking company. That’s what the fuck I do.”
-Bertram Gilfoyle, Silicon Valley
