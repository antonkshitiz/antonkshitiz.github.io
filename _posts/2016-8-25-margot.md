Because Margot Robbie was your source of technical information in the movie "The Big Short" which is kind of my inspiration to get into algorithmic trading and writing informative blogs about. Plus she's hot.

"Mortgage backed securities,
subprime loans, tranches… Pretty
confusing right? Does it make you
feel bored? Or stupid? Well, it’s
supposed to. Wall Street loves to
use confusing terms to make you
think only they can do what they
do. Or even better, for you to
leave them the fuck alone."
